If you compile QTwitdget by your self you must enter valid oauth consumer secret and key (oauth/oauth.cpp line 27 and 28).

I can give you QTwitdget OAuth secret/key if you contact me.

Or You can sign to Twitter OAuth Developer Beta for keys (of course you cannot use application name QTwitdget, choose whatever you want, 
twits will be shown with "from Application name").
